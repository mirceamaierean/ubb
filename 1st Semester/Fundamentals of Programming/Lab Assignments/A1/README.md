# :computer: Assignment 01

## Requirements
- Solve one problem statement from each set
- Write the solution to each problem statement in its corresponding Python module (`p1.py`, `p2.py` and `p3.py` respectively).
- Use functions, input parameters and return values
- Each function only does one thing!
- Do not use global variables
- Provide the user relevant messages regarding expected input and the meaning of the programâ€™s output.
- Assignment should be **completed by week 2, hard deadline is week 3**.

## Problem Statements
### First Set
4. For a given natural number `n` find the largest natural number written with the same digits. (e.g. `n=3658, m=8653`).

### Second Set
10. The palindrome of a number is the number obtained by reversing the order of its digits (e.g. the `palindrome of 237 is 732`). For a given natural number `n`, determine its palindrome.

### Third Set
13. Determine the `n-th`  element of the sequence `1,2,3,2,5,2,3,7,2,3,2,5,...` obtained from the sequence of natural numbers by replacing composed numbers with their prime divisors, without memorizing the elements of the sequence.
