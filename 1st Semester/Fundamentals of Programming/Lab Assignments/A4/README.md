# :computer: Assignment 04 - Problem Solving Methods

## Requirements
- You will have to solve two problem statements from the list below, one using the **backtracking** programming method and one using the **dynamic programming** method.
- For the backtracking problem, implement both an iterative as well as a recursive algorithm (**deadline is week 5**).
- For the dynamic programming problem, implement both the naive, non-optimized version as well as the dynamic programming version (**deadline is week 6**). 
- For the dynamic programming implementation, display the data structure used to memorize the intermediate results and be able to explain how it works. 
- For all implementations understand and be able to explain the computational complexity with regards to runtime.

## Problem Statements
### Backtracking
11. Two natural numbers `m` and `n` are given. Display in all possible modalities the numbers from `1` to `n`, such that between any two numbers on consecutive positions, the difference in absolute value is at least `m`. If there is no solution, display a message.

### Dynamic Programming
1. Determine the longest common subsequence of two given sequences. Subsequence elements are not required to occupy consecutive positions. For example, if `X = "MNPNQMN"` and `Y = "NQPMNM"`, the longest common subsequence has length `4`, and can be one of `"NQMN"`, `"NPMN"` or `"NPNM"`. Determine and display both the length of the longest common subsequence as well as at least one such subsequence.
