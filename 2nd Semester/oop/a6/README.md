# Assignment 06

## Problem Statement
For your solution to the previous assignment (Assignment 04-05), add the following features:
1. Replace the DynamicVector with the STL vector and modify your source code accordingly.

2. Use STL algorithms wherever possible in your application (e.g. in your filter function you could use `copy_if`, `count_if`). Replace all your for loops with STL algorithms. In cases where this is impossible replace your for loops with C++11's ranged-based for loop.

3. Test coverage must be at least 98% for all layers, except the UI. Use a coverage tool to demonstrate this.
