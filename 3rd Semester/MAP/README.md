# Advanced Programming Methods (not quite)

This course is/should be about advanced programming methods, such as design patterns, refactoring, testing, and debugging. The course is taught in Java, but the concepts are applicable to any programming language. Go to this repository's [Wiki](https://github.com/mirceamaierean/toy-language) to see the project requirements. Each assignment has its own branch, so you can see the code for each task by selecting the appropriate branch.
