% A study is conducted to compare heat loss in glass pipes, versus steel pipes of the same size. Various
% liquids at identical starting temperatures are run through segments of each type and the heat loss (in CÂº) is
% measured. These data result (normality of the two populations is assumed):

% Heat loss
% Steel [4.6, 0.7, 4.2, 1.9, 4.8, 6.1, 4.7, 5.5, 5.4];
% Glass [2.5, 1.3, 2.0, 1.8, 2.7, 3.2, 3.0, 3.5, 3.4];

% a. At the 5% significance level, do the population variances seem to differ?
% b. At the same significance level, does it seem that on average, steel pipes lose more heat than glass pipes?
