          <b>Formula 1</b> is the highest class of single-seater auto racing
          sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).
          <br />
          The "formula" in the name refers to a set of rules to which all
          participants and cars must conform. The F1 world championship season
          consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, held usually on
          purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets

        <h2>Engines in Formula 1</h2>
        <p>
          Formula 1 engines are a key component of the cars, and have evolved
          significantly over the years. Today, they are hybrid power units,
          combining a 1.6 litre V6 turbocharged engine with energy recovery
          systems.

        <aside>
          <h3>Did you know?</h3>
          <p>
            Formula 1 engines can rev up to 15,000 rpm and produce around 1000
            horsepower. However, the power units are not just about peak power,
            but also about how efficiently they can use fuel, and how much
            electrical power they can generate.
